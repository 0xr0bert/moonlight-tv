# Moonlight SDL

Moonlight SDL is a GUI front end for [moonlight-embedded](https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded).
It was originally designed for LG webOS TVs, but may support running in standard Linux in the future.

# Installing

Unfortunatly, LG webOS has many restrictions like time limited developer mode. Please follow instructions [here](http://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/app-test/)

# Building for webOS

Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/webosbrew/meta-lg-webos-ndk#cmake)

In order to build IPK package, you'll also need to have [jo](https://github.com/jpmens/jo) installed.
